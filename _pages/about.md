<div style="text-align: justify"> I am an Economics PhD student at Princeton University. Originally from Argentina, I hold a B.A. and an M.A. in Economics from the Universidad de San Andrés. <br> <br> 
I am part of the <a href="https://wfhresearch.com/gswadata/">Global Survey of Working Arrangements (G-SWA)</a>, which collects detailed information on workers’ experiences and attitudes regarding remote work arrangements. Before joining Princeton, I was a pre-doctoral Research Fellow at the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. <br> <br>
